# System by Selection - Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

## Overview

System by Selection is a modern multi-tenant SaaS platform designed for production logging, checklist management, and deviation tracking. The application serves multiple organizations (tenants) with modular functionality that can be enabled per tenant.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for authentication
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Internationalization**: i18next with Swedish and English support

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Email**: Nodemailer with React Email templates
- **Architecture Pattern**: Multi-tenant with tenant isolation at database level

### Database Design
- **Multi-tenancy**: All tenant-scoped tables include `tenantId` foreign key
- **Modules**: Tenant-specific feature flags determine available functionality
- **Security**: Row-level tenant isolation enforced in application layer
- **Schema**: Shared schema with tenant-scoped data segregation

## Key Components

### Multi-Tenant Core
- **Tenants**: Central tenant management with module configuration
- **Users**: Role-based access control (superadmin, admin, underadmin, user)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with tenant context
- **Authorization**: Module-based permissions and role validation

### Module System
The platform uses a modular architecture where tenants can enable specific modules:

1. **Checklists Module**
   - Dynamic form creation and management
   - Work task, work station, and shift organization
   - Response collection and dashboard analytics
   - Configurable question types (text, numbers, switches, stars, etc.)

2. **Deviations Module** (Planned)
   - Issue tracking and management
   - Email notifications
   - Status workflows
   - Assignment and commenting system

### Security Architecture
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT verification with role validation
- **Tenant Isolation**: Automatic tenant ID injection and validation
- **Module Access Control**: Per-module permission checking
- **API Security**: Comprehensive request validation and sanitization

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User provides credentials + optional tenant selection
2. System validates credentials and tenant access
3. JWT token generated with user + tenant context
4. All subsequent requests include tenant context
5. Middleware enforces tenant isolation

### Request Processing
1. **Authentication**: JWT token validation
2. **Tenant Resolution**: Extract tenant context from token
3. **Module Validation**: Verify tenant has access to requested module
4. **Data Access**: Automatic tenant scoping for database queries
5. **Response**: Tenant-scoped data returned

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- All tenant-scoped database operations include tenantId filter
- Middleware prevents cross-tenant data access
- Superadmin users can access tenant management functions
- Regular users restricted to their tenant's data only

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@radix-ui/**: UI component primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **bcryptjs**: Password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken**: JWT authentication
- **nodemailer**: Email notifications
- **@react-email/**: Email template rendering

### Development Tools
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Fast production bundling
- **vite**: Development server and build tool
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles Node.js application to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: `npm run dev` - TSX with hot reload
- **Production**: `npm run build && npm run start` - Optimized bundle
- **Database**: `npm run db:push` - Apply schema changes

### Replit Integration
- **Modules**: nodejs-20, web, postgresql-16
- **Auto-deployment**: Configured for autoscale deployment
- **Port Configuration**: Internal 5000 â†’ External 80
- **Database**: Automatic PostgreSQL provisioning
